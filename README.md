## Project Background & System Overview

Many methods for providing respiratory support to patients are currently in use, however more commonly available techniques such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) are not appropriate for ventilation of patients with an airborne infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. These methods pose the risk of extensive aerosolization, which endangers other patients and hospital staff. Recognizing this problem, we designed a hermetically sealed device to provide non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) while minimizing or eliminating the risk of infection for other patients and hospital staff.

The bubble helmet is a device that delivers NIPPV to patients requiring respiratory support by interfacing with high-flow hospital oxygen, CPAP machines, or mechanical ventilators. The helmet is a single-part device that consists of an optically transparent and flexible hood, within which the wearer’s head is contained, with a flexible neck gasket that provides a seal around the wearer’s neck. Standard medical ports are attached to the hood allowing for the administration of gasses, while straps on the hood secure the helmet to the wearer’s body.

## Installation Instructions
1. Review our testing results (located in this GitHub repo) to become familiar with what this design can achieve.
2. Download the assembly and concept documents from the [Cosmic Medical Website](https://cosmicmedical.ca/bh-28-warnings-disclaimers)
3. Review the Bubble Helmet donning and doffing guides (located in this GitHub repo).
